                Preparing for future applications can be a confusing or intimidating process for
                most high school students because they must complete many deadline-driven tasks. If
                you miss deadlines, you miss excellent opportunities and it will be hard for you to
                look for new ones. Find your great college, take special tests, complete essays and
                your application, search for available scholarships or grants to pay your education
                expenses.
